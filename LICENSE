THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS 
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS 
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE 
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS 
PROHIBITED. 

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND 
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
THE  RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, 
     anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in 
     unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, 
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are 
     assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a 
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as 
     defined below) for the purposes of this License. 

  b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the 
     Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical 
     arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture 
     version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, 
     condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, 
     transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a 
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the 
     purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the 
     Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the 
     synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image 
     ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose 
     of this License. 

  c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work 
     under the terms of this License. 

  d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the 
     Work. 

  e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under 
     the terms of this License. 

  f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this 
     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License 
     with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission 
     from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a 
     previous violation. 

  g. "License Elements" means the following high-level license 
     attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of 
     this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this 
     License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-
     exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright)
     license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below

       1. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or 
          more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as 
          incorporated in the Collective Works; 

       2. to create and reproduce Derivative Works; 

       3. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, 
          perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital 
          audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in 
          Collective Works; 

       4. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, 
          perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital

       5. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical 
          composition:

            a. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor 
               waives the exclusive right to collect, whether 
               individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. 
               ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance 
               or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.

            b. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor 
               waives the exclusive right to collect, whether 
               individually or via a music rights society or designated 
               agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any 
               phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and 
               distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 
               17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the 
               equivalent in other jurisdictions). 
         
       6. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
          doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the 
          exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a 
          performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for 
          the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, 
          subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 
          of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other 
          jurisdictions).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

  b. ShareAlike.

     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.

       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
          license with the same License Elements, this version or
          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.

       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
          context in which You Share Adapted Material.

       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,

     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
