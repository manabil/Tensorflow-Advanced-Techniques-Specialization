In C2W4 Assignment you must have a **test model** so that all cell code can run smoothly.

After I checked the checksum on the week 3 test model it turned out to be the ***same as the week 4*** test model, therefore so that the repo size doesn't get bigger you can copy the week 3 test model to week 4

The path is the same as week 3. Copy the test model here (`data/resnet_50_feature_vector`)

```bash
